        <span>About Brand?</span>
        <p>Brew Craft is a coffee brand that combines the rich traditions of Vietnamese and Italian coffee. <br> 
            Known for its wide range of flavors, Brew Craft takes pride in using traditional brewing methods passed down through generations. <br> 
            By blending bold Vietnamese techniques with Italian artistry, it offers a unique and sophisticated coffee experience. <br> 
            Brew Craft is more than just coffee; it's a celebration of tradition and culture in every sip, with a modern, stylish twist.

        <div>
        <span>Central Ideation</span>
        <p> Brew Craftâ€™s packaging design combines modern typography with traditional cultural elements. <br> 
            After researching the brand, I learned that Vietnamese and Italian coffee is a long-standing tradition, not just a flavor. <br> 
            With this in mind, I created a design that mixes a modern style with a nod to tradition, which the brand loved.</p></div>


        <div>
        <span>Custom Typography</span>
        <p>For Brew Craft, Iâ€™ve chosen two fonts to enhance the brandâ€™s identity. <br> 
            Britannic Bold is used for the logo, giving it a timeless and elegant look, while Agency FB is the secondary font, <br> 
            adding a modern, sleek feel. Together, they create a perfect balance, combining luxury <br>
            with vintage charm to reflect Brew Craftâ€™s rich heritage and sophisticated style.</p></div>

        <span>Overall experience</span>
        <p>The design experience with Brew Craft was next level. As a packaging designer, <br> 
            I enjoyed exploring the rich blend of traditional and modern Vietnamese and Italian coffee cultures. <br> 
            The result is a visually stunning and informative design that perfectly reflects the brandâ€™s unique legacy and quality.
