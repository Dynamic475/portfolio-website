        <span>About Brand?</span>
        <p>HK5 is an e-bike brand focused on creating better electric bikes every year. <br> 
            Known for its modern designs and advanced technology, HK5 aims to improve the riding experience with each new model. <br>

        <div>
        <span>Central Ideation</span>
        <p>HK5 wanted a logo that showed its modern and innovative style. <br> 
            I designed a unique emblem by combining the letter "H" and the number "5" in a bold, simple way. <br> 
            This blend of elements gives HK5 a strong and stylish identity, perfectly reflecting the brandâ€™s forward-thinking <br> 
            vision in the e-bike industry.</p></div>


        <div>
        <span>Custom Typography</span>
        <p> For HK5, I chose the Acumin Variable Concept font familyâ€”it felt like the perfect match for the brandâ€™s bold, modern vibe. <br> 
            This fontâ€™s unique versatility and clarity add a fresh, stylish edge to HK5's look. <br> 
            and highlighting the brandâ€™s innovative spirit and giving it a dynamic, contemporary feel. <br> 
            I also made some custom adjustments to the font to create the final logo, fitting it perfectly to HK5's identity.
