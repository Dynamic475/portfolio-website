        <div>
        <span>Central Ideation</span>
        <p>As a web designer, I was responsible for making the platform look more modern and attractive <br>
            The aim was to design a web interface for Groovo that could be easily understood by everyone. <br> 
            I designed this website for the Groovo brand to ensure that users can navigate and understand it effortlessly. <br> 
            allowing anyone interacting with the site to feel confident and in control.</p></div>


        <div>
        <span>Cross-functional Collaboration</span>
        <p>I worked closely with the founder and the team responsible for building the project from the very beginning. <br> 
        This ensured that communication between us was clear and effective. Since the project was new and innovative, <br>
        good communication was especially important because we were all new to this type of work.</p></div>

        <span>Overall experience</span>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed working with Groovo on this project. It presented some interesting challenges, <br> 
            particularly in designing and aligning the icons and text on the website. <br> 
            The goal was to ensure that the website remained intuitive and easy to navigate for users, <br> 
            and that's the reason We carefully considered how every element was placed and designed, <br> 
            all to enhance the overall user experience.
            It was a rewarding process, and I'm proud of how it turned out.</p></div>
