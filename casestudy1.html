        <span>What is Memri Connect?</span>
        <p>Memri Connect is a smart technology that helps you take control of your data and make smarter choices in life. In short,<br>
        helps you weed out the noise and focus on the most important things in shorter time and connect with <br> 
        the people that are most important to you.</p></div>

        <div>
        <span>Central Challenge</span>
        <p>The main focus was to create a mobile app that smoothly brings together data and relationships. <br> 
        This app uses both individually and collectively trained smart features to customize your experience.</p></div>


        <div>
        <span>Cross-functional Collaboration</span>
        <p>I worked closely with the founder and the team responsible for building the project from the very beginning. <br> 
        This ensured that communication between us was clear and effective. Since the project was new and innovative, <br>
        good communication was especially important because we were all new to this type of work.</p></div>

    <div class="lower-text">
        <span>Pattern Identification</span>
        <p>I began the design process by studying how people typically interact with similar products already available.<br>
            Even though we wanted to introduce new features,<br> 
            understanding these common patterns helped us create a user-friendly experience that aligns with what people are used to.<br> 
            We used the same approach for the other three apps.</p></div>
