        <span>About Brand?</span>
        <p>Pulse Gaming, founded in 2024, aims to create exciting, high-quality games for the next generation of players. <br>
            Driven by creativity, innovation, and a love for gaming, Pulse has become a leader in game development. Each game by Pulse showcases its dedication <br>
            to advancing gameplay, storytelling, and visuals. <br> 
            As the company grows, Pulse remains committed 
            to delivering experiences that connect with players 
            around the world, <br>
            bringing them into new worlds 
            and memorable adventures.</p></div>

        <div>
        <span>Central Ideation</span>
        <p>The main focus of the brand was speed, and they wanted this 
            reflected in the logo as a bold, stylish symbol. <br>
            I associated speed with a horse and explored several design
            ideas around this concept to capture the brand's identity. <br>
            In the final design, I focused on the horse's leg movement, 
            creating a bold, iconic symbol inspired by the angle 
            and gap in the horse's leg to represent speed effectively.</p></div>


        <div>
        <span>Custom Typography</span>
        <p>I designed a custom font just for the brand, bringing in the bold, aggressive, 
            and gaming-inspired style they wanted. <br>
            This unique font boosts their brand identity with 
            a striking look that perfectly fits their style. </p></div>
